Replicate some basic statistics in the news about 2019 District Council Elections in Hong Kong

There are some disputes around the number of votes and seats earned by pro-establishment and pro-democracy camps. The most confusing one is described below: 

**What does the turnout rate imply?**

The turnout rate (# actual voters/# registered votes) of 2019 HK Distric Council elections, 71.23%, broke the previously highest record, 47.01%, created at last HK District Council elections in 2015 after [Umbrella Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_protests). This new record is regarded as a result of [the current pro-democracy protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_protests) which has aroused the awareness of political engagement among young Hong Kong citizens. Most of these young people are thought to be pro-democracy. No wonder the number of seats won by the pro-establishment camp dropped drastically from 299 (69.14%) in 2015 to 59 (13%) in 2019.

However, the percentage of votes earned by the pro-establishment camp didn't change too much from 54.61% in 2015 to 41.32% in 2019. The 4:6 ratio between the estabishment and the democracy is basically maintained. This fact seemed to refute the impression that new voters are all pro-democracy. Supposed that old voters didn't change their stances, new voters must come from both camps.

Stillï¼Œit is not the entire case. There is a coincidence between two numbers -- 440k, the number of newly registered voters in 2019, and 441k, the number of net increase of votes that the establishment camp received in 2019. If we just look at these two number, it seems to imply that most newly registered voters vote for the establishment.

To sum up, the three statitics, 1) 71.23%, 2) 41.32%, and 3) 441k, resulting from the same event can imply three statements that are mutually exclusive, most new voters voted for 1) pro-democracy, 2) both camps, 3) pro-Beijing.

What is the fact? This project aims to resolve the dispute through data visualization.
